# Local modern Data stack

Vision: Serve as a reference for how the local modern data stack can be used in practice.
Over time build more production grade features and deployment modes to serve as a go-to example for others to spread the use of the software engineering best practices in the LMDS.

items will be checked:

- [ ] to be done

## open points

to be discussed if we want to include them

- [ ] support multiple deployment modes i.e. local, docker, k8s local via Âµ-k8s in i.e. rancher desktop, cloud
- [ ] how do lambda functions fit in? In particular ones like: https://modal.com/
- [ ] anomaly detection with dagster stateful asset checks
- [ ] full blown metrics samples based on E2E company tooling mentioned i.e. https://github.com/geoHeil/awesome-tools/blob/master/startup_company.md
- [ ] including commercial PaaS?
